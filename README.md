# INOMAD-DEMO

### Introduction

<hr>

This is the demo repository for INOMAD, an e-commerce platform for a sustainable furniture design studio.

The project is currently still under development (deployment stage), so below is the demo video as a showcase of my work.

Due to the business nature of this project, the original repository is private. Code samples available upon request.
